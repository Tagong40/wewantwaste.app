This project is a modern, responsive product catalog page built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates best practices for component architecture, state management, and asynchronous data fetching.

The UI is built using a dark-themed design system and is fully responsive and accessible.
Core Technologies

    React: For building the user interface with a component-based architecture.

    TypeScript: For static typing to improve code quality and maintainability.

    Tailwind CSS: For a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid, custom UI development.

    Zustand: For a minimal, fast, and scalable global state management solution.

    Axios: For making promise-based HTTP requests to fetch product data.

Key Features

    Component-Based Architecture: The UI is broken down into logical, reusable components like Header, FilterSidebar, and ProductCard.

    Global State Management: Utilizes Zustand to manage application-wide state (like filters and products) in a simple, decoupled manner.

    Asynchronous Data Fetching: Demonstrates fetching product data from a mock API using Axios, with proper handling of loading and error states.

    Responsive & Accessible: The layout is fully responsive and adheres to accessibility best practices, including semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation support.

    Centralized Theming: Colors and styles are defined in tailwind.config.js for easy customization and consistency.
